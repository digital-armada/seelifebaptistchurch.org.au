                            Malls are trendy. Churches should feel timeless.
                            With the forceful current of constant change
                            sweeping over every part of our lives, people have
                            the need to connect with something enduring and
                            firm. We believe Christ designed the church to
                            fulfill that need by representing an eternal kingdom
                            and ageless truth with no need to imitate the
                            culture. We want you to know that we are a real
                            church that still feels like church. It won't feel
                            like a rock concert, comedy club, or motivational
                            seminar. It's not old-fashioned, as in 50 years ago.
                            It's timeless, as in 2000 years ago. See Life

                                Most church music amounts to dumbing down the
                                lyrics and cranking up the volume to build
                                interest. The hymns we sing still generate a
                                real attitude towards God that is anything but
                                lifeless and boring.
